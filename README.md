# POWER-BI-JOB-STIMULATION

Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualisation needs. Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions. Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis. Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively. I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working with data visualization using Microsoft PowerBI for diversity and inclusion in the corporate world, and Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills at a company like PwC.
